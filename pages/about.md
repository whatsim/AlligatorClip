##About AlligatorClip

So, AlligatorClip is my third content management system.

The first, Bleedwrite was built around destroying any distinction between the public site and the admin panel, [its online here](http://bleedwrite.willruby.com/). When logged in it uses ContentEditable to make the whole site editable. It was fun, and very low barrier to making things, which was sort of the point, but like a gun without a safety, its sort of unwieldy, and to its detriment, its written in PHP, so at a certain point I abandoned all the back bits and just took the drag and drop and other code from the front that was worth keeping.

The second is sort of three in one, I know, I know. Doesn't that mean that AlligatorClip is my fifth? Well, not really, the next three shared a considerable amount of code and methodology, and were written concurrently for seperate projects. One is identitycms, which runs my portfolio on [willruby.com](http://www.willruby.com). The second is Ethic, my as yet unpublished and unused forumware that I wrote for my thesis project, documented I just realized nowhere, so I suppose I'll have to be adding that to the portfolio. The third is a CMS for elevator video art installations that I wrote for the agency I worked at at the time. These were built on node.js with mongodb backends, and [willruby.com](http://www.willruby.com) has been running without incident or intervention for the better part of a year.

That said, that particular use case doesn't really require a application server running all the time that builds pages from a database. Its been static for nearly its entire life in production, it could rather easily just be a series of flat files, and arguably should be. So AlligatorClip is my attempt at a static site generator, much in the tradition of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), driven from flat files, generated by the user when something changes, and uploaded as a group.

I'm not aware of any deficiency with other static site generators out there, I just like making my own tools, so I don't know that AlligatorClip will offer anything that the other options don't. In all reality, it will probably be less flexible, but there it is.
