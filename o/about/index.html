<p>So, BinderClip is my third content management system.</p>

<p>The first, Bleedwrite was built around destroying any distinction between the site and administration, <a href="http://bleedwrite.willruby.com/">its online here</a>. When logged in it uses ContentEditable to make the whole site editable. It was fun, and very low barrier to making things, which was sort of the point, but like a gun without a safety, its sort of unwieldy, and to its detriment, its written in PHP, so at a certain point I abandoned all the back bits and just took the drag and drop and other code from the front that was worth hanging on to.</p>

<p>The second is sort of three in one, I know doesn't that mean that BinderClip is my fifth? Well, not really, the next three shared a considerable amount of code and methodology, and were written concurrently for seperate projects. One is identitycms, which runs my portfolio on <a href="http://www.willruby.com">www.willruby.com</a>. The second is Ethic, my as yet unpublished and unused forumware that I wrote for my thesis project, documented I just realized nowhere, so I suppose I'll have to be adding that to the portfolio. The third is a CMS for elevator video art installations that I wrote for the agency I worked at at the time. These were built on node.js with mongodb backends, and <a href="http://www.willruby.com">www.willruby.com</a> has been running without incident or intervention for the better part of a year.</p>

<p>That said, that particular use case doesn't really require a application server running all the time that builds pages from a database. Its been static for nearly its entire life in production, it could rather easily just be a series of flat files, and argueably should be. So BinderClip, much in the tradition of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> is my attempt at a static site generator, driven from flat files, generated by the user when something changes, and uploaded as a group.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any deficiency with other static site generators out there, I just like making my own tools, so I don't know that BinderClip will offer anything that the other options don't. In all reality, it will probably be less flexible, but there it is.</p></div>
