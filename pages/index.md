Home Page

This is a home page [about](/o/about). I should have a macro of some kind to link internally. I wonder how I'd do that.

	Code Sample

	So goal is to have a filesystem based static site generator.

	To that end I need to:

		[X] parse directory structure into site representation.
			[X] need better per page/article configuration
		[X] step through that and gen everything. 
		[/] copy images, styles over
		[ ] less renderer, I mean. we've come this far
		[ ] blog listing
		[ ] tagging, now we're getting crazy
			[ ] categories from directories?
		[ ] dropbox integration? too crazy?

	Without a blog, this is relatively easy, so, we'll start there I think.
